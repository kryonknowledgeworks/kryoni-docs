## Managing Revisions: Sending Feedback to the Author

After a reviewer has submitted feedback—especially if a revision is recommended—the editorial team must determine whether the author needs to revise the manuscript and whether a new review cycle is required. Kryoni JMS provides a streamlined Request Revision workflow to manage this process efficiently.

### Next Step: Sending Revisions to the Author

Once the editorial team has reviewed the feedback and comments from the reviewer(s), they can forward the necessary revisions to the author for correction or improvement.

#### Steps to Send a Revision Request

##### Step 1: Click Action > Request Revision

    - Navigate to the manuscript in the editorial dashboard.
    - Click the **“Actions”** dropdown.
    - Select **“Request Revision”** to begin the revision process.

##### Step 2: Decide on Review Cycle Requirement

The editor must determine whether the revised manuscript should undergo another peer review round:

    - **Revisions Will Not Be Subject to a New Round**
        - Select this if the revisions are **minor** or editorial in nature and do not require further peer evaluation.
        - The manuscript will return to the editorial team for final decision after resubmission.
    - **Require New Review Round**
        - Select this if the revisions are **substantial** and need to be evaluated again by the same or new reviewers.
        - A new review round will automatically begin once the author resubmits.

##### Step3: Add Author Note

    - Provide **clear, specific instructions** to the author based on the reviewer feedback.
    - Highlight:
        - Major areas for improvement
        - Formatting or compliance issues
        - Any editorial comments or required clarifications

##### Step 4: Select Review Files to Share with the Author

    - Choose **which files or reviewer comments** should be shared with the author.
    - These may include:
        - Review forms
        - Annotated manuscripts
        - Supplementary comments or attachments

##### Step 5: Submit the Revision Request

    - After adding notes and selecting files, click **“Submit”**.
    - The manuscript status will update to **"Revisions Requested"**.
    - The author will receive an **automated email notification** with the editor’s message and attached files.

### Viewing Revision Details

Once a revision request has been submitted, a new **Revision Details** tab becomes available on the manuscript’s page. This section tracks and displays all relevant information regarding the requested revision.
