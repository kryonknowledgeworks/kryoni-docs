### The final step in creating the journal

The journal preview section allows you to review and confirm all the information configured during the journal creation process. This final step ensures that every setting is accurate and meets your expectations, preventing potential errors that could impact submissions, reviews, or publication workflows.

To finalize the journal setup:
    - Review : Verify that all the journal configurations are correct.

Your journal will now be officially established within the JMS and ready for use.

Once your journal is officially created, you'll be directed to the Journal Dashboard where all your journals are listed. Here, you'll see essential details for each journal, including:

    - **Journal name:** The full title of your journal as configured during setup.
    
    - **Abbreviation/acronym:** A shortened version of the journal name for quick reference.

    - **Date of creation:** The date the journal was officially established in the system.

    - **Last updated at:** The most recent date when changes were made to the journal settings.

    - **Action:** Options to manage your journal, such as view or delete.

This dashboard provides a clear overview, making it easy to manage and track your journals efficiently.
