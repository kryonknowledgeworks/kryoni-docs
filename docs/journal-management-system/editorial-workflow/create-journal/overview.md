# Creating Your Journal: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Overview

Creating a journal within our Journal Management System (JMS) is a fundamental step in establishing a robust framework for your publishing house’s editorial workflows, manuscript submissions, and publishing operations. JMS simplifies this process, requiring minimal effort while allowing you to focus on delivering high-quality content. The system enables you to easily manage your journal’s configurations and update them as your needs evolve—without disrupting existing processes.

### Why Creating a Journal Matters

The journal creation process within JMS is essential because it serves as the framework for all future activities, including manuscript submissions, peer reviews, editorial management, and publication tracking. The setup ensures that your journal aligns with your editorial policies and meets the expectations of contributors and readers.

### Adaptability and Flexibility

Our JMS empowers you with complete control over the journal’s settings. As your journal grows or pivots to new editorial directions, submission guidelines, or publication policies, you won’t need to restart the setup. Instead, you can make necessary changes seamlessly within the system, ensuring continuity and smooth operations.

### Key Configuration Steps

The setup process involves providing important details, such as the journal’s name, description, and submission policies. These details are crucial, as they will be visible to authors during the submission process and will shape how they engage with your journal.

This information helps authors understand your journal’s scope and policies, ensuring that only relevant submissions are made. It also sets clear expectations for peer review and publication timelines, fostering smoother collaboration between authors, reviewers, and editors.
