## Reviewer Submits Final Decision on Revised Manuscript

    **Step 1: Reviewer Receives Notification**

        - The assigned reviewer receives an automated email.

        - The email includes a secure link to log in to Kryoni JMS and access the revised submission.

    **Step 2: Reviewer Evaluates the Revision**

        - The reviewer logs in, downloads the updated manuscript, and reviews the changes.

        - Based on their evaluation, the reviewer submits a final recommendation.

**Possible Final Recommendations:**

        - **Accept Submission.**

        - **Request Further Revisions.**

        - **Decline Submission.**

    **Example:**

    **Accept Submission** - The reviewer is satisfied with the changes and recommends acceptance.

    **Step 3: Final Review Submission (EDITORIAL USER TAB)**

        - Once the reviewer submits their final recommendation:

            - The **Review Status** is updated to **“Review Completed.”**

            - The **Recommendation** is displayed (e.g., Accept Submission).

            - The manuscript appears under the **Review Completed** tab.

    **Note on Pending Revisions**

    If a reviewer has not yet submitted their review, you may encounter the following warning:

    **“This submission has pending revisions. Please address them before proceeding to the production stage.”**

This message appears to **prevent premature transition** to the production stage while active review processes are still ongoing.

#### What to Do Next

    **Option 1: Wait for the Reviewer to Complete the Review**

    If the reviewer is actively engaged, the editorial team should wait until the review is submitted.

    **Option 2: Cancel the Reviewer (if delayed or unresponsive)**

     If the reviewer is significantly delayed or unresponsive, the editorial user can:

        - Navigate to the reviewer assignment.

        - Use the **Actions > Cancel Reviewer** option.

        - Proceed with the editorial decision or reassign the manuscript to another reviewer if needed.

    ##### Final Step: Accept and Move to Production

    Once all reviews are complete and the editorial team is satisfied with the manuscript:

    ###### Steps to Accept and Move to Production

        - Go to the **All Reviews** tab.

        - Locate the manuscript and click the **Action** button.

        - Select **“Accept and Move to Production”** from the dropdown.
