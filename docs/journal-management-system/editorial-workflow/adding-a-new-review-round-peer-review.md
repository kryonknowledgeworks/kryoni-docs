## Adding Reviewers to the Peer Review Process

### Why Adding Reviewers is Important

The peer review process is a cornerstone of maintaining academic quality and integrity. Assigning expert reviewers ensures that each manuscript meets the journal's standards before publication. JMS simplifies the task of managing and adding reviewers, making it easy to ensure that the review process is thorough and efficient.

#### Steps to Add Reviewers

    - To assign reviewers, Go to **all reviews**
    - Click on add reviewer
    - If no reviewers are currently assigned to the journal, you’ll see the message: "No reviewers have been assigned to this journal yet – Click here to add reviewers." This link will direct you to the **Add Reviewer** page.

#### Adding Reviewers by Email

If the reviewer is already registered in the system, you can simply add them by typing their email address in the Add User field. JMS will auto-populate suggestions based on registered users.

    - If the email address does not match an existing user, you can invite them to the platform.

#### Inviting New Reviewers

    - For unregistered reviewers, click Invite User. An invitation link will be sent to their email address. Refer [Inviting New Reviewers](/journal-management-system/settings/global-organizations-settings/users)
    - Once they accept the invitation, they will officially become part of the JMS system as a reviewer.

:::note
All actions performed in JMS, such as adding reviewers or making editorial decisions, trigger automated email notifications to the concerned parties, keeping everyone informed of updates in real time.

### Add Reviewer

    ![image](https://cdn.kryoni.com/kryoni-docs/images/new-review/add-reviewer-details.webp)

#### Step 1: Click "Add Reviewer"

    - On all reviews screen, click the **“+Add Reviewer”** button.

        ![image](https://cdn.kryoni.com/kryoni-docs/images/new-review/adding-reviewer-email.webp)

    - A dropdown will appear with two options:

        ![image](https://cdn.kryoni.com/kryoni-docs/images/new-review/drop-two-options.webp)
        

        - **Create New Queue** – Used to initiate a batch-based or phase-wise review.
        - **Add Individual Reviewer** – Used to directly assign a specific reviewer to the manuscript.

Let’s first explore
    **Option 1: Creating a New Queue**

1. Select **“Create New Queue”** from the dropdown

    ![image](https://cdn.kryoni.com/kryoni-docs/images/new-review/create-new-queue.webp)

    This opens the setup for a new review queue.

#### Step 2: Setting a Reviewer Limit

    ![image](https://cdn.kryoni.com/kryoni-docs/images/new-review/setting-reviewer-limit.webp)

**Reviewer Limit** allows you to define the maximum number of reviewers required for a manuscript. Once that number of reviewers **accepts** the invitation, all remaining **pending invitations will be automatically cancelled.**

#### Example

If the limit is set to **2** and you invite **5** reviewers:

    - Once **2 reviewers accept**, the system will **automatically cancel invitations** sent to the remaining 3.
    - This helps maintain clarity and control without requiring manual intervention.
    
#### Use Case: Streamlining Peer Review with Reviewer Limits

#### Use Case

Managing the review process for a research paper titled **“AI in Healthcare”**. Dr. Smith, a journal editor, wishes to assign reviewers while avoiding unnecessary follow-ups.

##### Steps Taken

##### 1. Send Invitations

    - Dr. Smith invites four reviewers: Dr. Adams, Dr. Lee, Dr. Patel, and Dr. Johnson.

##### 2. Automated Reviewer Assignment

    - For example: Dr. Adams and Dr. Lee accept first.
    - The system automatically cancels pending invitations to Dr. Patel and Dr. Johnson.

#### Outcome

    - The manuscript proceeds with **two confirmed reviewers**.
    - The editorial team does **not need to manually track or cancel** excess invitations.

#### Why Use the Reviewer Limit?

    - **Prevents Over-Assignment** – Avoids redundant or excessive reviewer engagement.
    - **Saves Time** – Reduces the need for manual cancellation of pending invites.
    - **Ensures Efficiency** – Keeps the peer review process clean, controlled, and timely.

#### Step 3: Select a reviewer from the list

![image](https://cdn.kryoni.com/kryoni-docs/images/new-review/select-reviewer-list.webp)

Each reviewer listed includes a summary of their profile and activity to help you make informed decisions.

### Reviewer Assignment Options

Kryoni JMS provides flexible methods to assign reviewers to a manuscript, ensuring that editorial users can manage review workflows efficiently and with full control.

#### Option 1: Edit Existing Queue

If you've already created a review queue and want to add more reviewers to it:

1. Click **“Edit Existing Queue”** from the **+Add Reviewer** dropdown.
2. Select a **reviewer from the list.**
3. Set the **Response Due Date** – the deadline for the reviewer to accept or decline the invitation.
4. Set the **Review Due Date** – the deadline for the reviewer to submit their evaluation.

Use this option when continuing an ongoing review phase without creating a new queue.

#### Option 2: Create New Queue

If you're starting a second phase of review or want to isolate reviewer sets, click **“Create New Queue.”**
    - You can set a **new reviewer limit** specific to this queue.
    - Useful for resubmissions, multiple review rounds, or editorial segmentation.

#### Option 3: Add Individual Reviewer

Use this option when you want **direct control** over reviewer assignment.

1. Click **“Add Individual Reviewer.”**

    ![image](https://cdn.kryoni.com/kryoni-docs/images/new-review/add-individual-reviewer.webp)

2. Select a specific reviewer with the right expertise.
3. Assign **Response** and **Review Due Dates.**
4. Send a **personalized review invitation.**

Ideal for high-priority manuscripts or when a specific reviewer’s input is essential.

### Why Use "Add Individual Reviewer"?

![image](https://cdn.kryoni.com/kryoni-docs/images/new-review/reviewer-invited-box.webp)

    - **Manual selection** gives you complete control.
    - Best suited for **targeted or high-value assignments.**
    - Ensures **direct delivery** of the review invitation, avoiding queue rules.

### Now All Reviewers Are Assigned – Understanding Review Categories

Once reviewers are assigned to a manuscript, they are categorized based on their status and the review process setup. The system ensures smooth tracking and management of each reviewer’s progress.

### Reviewer Categories

#### 1️. All Reviewers

This category displays **all assigned reviewers** for the manuscript, regardless of their current status.

##### Displayed Information

![image](https://cdn.kryoni.com/kryoni-docs/images/new-review/displayed-information.webp)

    - **Reviewer Name** – Name of the assigned reviewer.
    - **Response Due Date** – Deadline for the reviewer to accept the invitation.
    - **Review Due Date** – Deadline to submit their review.
    - **Recommendation** – Reviewer's decision (Accept, Revise, Reject, etc.).
    - **Status** – The current stage of the review.
    - **Action(s)** – Editors can take actions such as sending reminders or cancelling invitations.

    ###### Viewing Detailed Reviewer Information

To access **additional details** about an assigned reviewer, follow these steps:

![image](https://cdn.kryoni.com/kryoni-docs/images/new-review/additional-information.webp)

##### Steps to View Reviewer Information

 1. **Click on the Reviewer Name** in the review list.
 2. A **Reviewer Information Tab** will open, displaying key details such as:
    - **Reviewer Email** – The email address of the assigned reviewer.
    - **Type** – The type of review assigned, e.g., **Single-Blind, Double-Blind, or Open Review**.
    - **Review Sent Files** – Manuscript files and any supplementary materials shared with the reviewer.
    - **Request Review Form** – The structured review form provided for the reviewer to submit feedback.

#### 2. Queue

This category applies when a **Reviewer Limit** is set, meaning only a specific number of reviewers are allowed to proceed.

##### Queue ID and Total Accepted

###### Queue ID

    - A **unique identifier** assigned to each review queue when a **Reviewer Limit** is set.
    - Helps track and manage multiple review rounds efficiently.

###### Total Accepted

    - Displays the **number of reviewers who have accepted the invitation** within the set limit.
    - Once the **limit is reached**, remaining pending invitations are automatically cancelled.

#### Example Scenario

**An editor is handling two different manuscripts with separate reviewer limits.**

| Queue ID |Manuscript ID | Reviewer Limit | Total Accepted|Pending Invitations|
|----------|--------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
|Queue -1  |    KJMS-007  |               3| 2/3           | 2 (waiting)       |
|Queue -2  |    KJMS-008  |               2| 2/2           | 0 (limit reached) |

    - Queue -1 still has **one more slot** available before reaching the limit.
    - Queue –2 has already **filled its reviewer slots**, so any remaining **pending invitations are cancelled.**
    - Editors can track and manage multiple queues efficiently using **Queue ID and Total Accepted reviewers.**

##### Viewing the List of Reviewers in a Queue

To see the list of reviewers assigned to a specific **Queue**, follow these steps:

###### Steps to View Assigned Reviewers

1️. **Click on the Queue Name** in the Review Round Dashboard.

2️. A **Queue Information Panel** will open, displaying details of all assigned reviewers.

##### Displayed Information in Queue

|Field              |Description                                            |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|**Reviewer Name**      |Name of the assigned reviewer                          |
|**Response Due Date**  |Deadline for the reviewer to accept the invitation     |
|**Review Due Date**    |Deadline for submitting their review                   |
|**Recommendation**     |Reviewer's decision (Accept, Revise, Reject, etc.)     |
|**Status**             |Current stage (Pending, Accepted, Completed, Overdue)  |
|**Action(s)**          |Editors can send reminders or cancel invitations       |

#### Add Individual Reviewer

The **Individual** category is used when reviewers are assigned manually, without placing them in a queue or setting a **Reviewer Limit**. This method offers complete flexibility and is ideal for targeted assignments where specific reviewers are chosen for their expertise.
