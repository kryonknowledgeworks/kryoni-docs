# Decision-Making on a Manuscript Submission in Kryoni JMS

The **Decision-Making Process** in **Kryoni Journal Management System (JMS)** enables journal manager or editors to efficiently evaluate manuscript submissions and determine the appropriate course of action. This ensures a **Structured and Transparent Editorial Workflow** while maintaining journal quality standards.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Making a Decision on a Manuscript

### 1. Access the Submission

    - Log in to your **Kryoni JMS** account.
    - Navigate to the appropriate **journal list**.
    - Locate the submission under the **“Manuscript Submissions”** section.
    - Click on the manuscript title to open the submission detail page.

### 2. Review the Submitted Files

    - Go to the **“Files”** tab within the submission view.
    - Download the main manuscript and any supplementary documents.
    - Conduct an initial review to check:
        - Whether the manuscript aligns with the **journal's aims and scope**.
        - The **quality of writing and research methodology**.
        - Completeness of required files such as cover letter, figures, tables, and metadata.

### 3. Conduct Pre-Review Screening

Before proceeding to peer review, carry out a pre-screening check:
    - **Scope Validation:**

        Use the built-in **OOS (Out of Scope) Score Checker** to assess topic relevance.
    - **Compliance Check:**

        Confirm that the manuscript complies with:
        - **Ethical guidelines** (e.g., plagiarism, consent, funding disclosures)
        - **Formatting requirements** set by the journal
    - **Anonymization (if needed)**:

        If the journal follows a blind or double-blind review model, ensure the manuscript is anonymized before assigning reviewers.

### 4. Making a Decision

Once the manuscript has been evaluated, take an editorial decision using the **Actions dropdown menu**. The available options include:

    - **Accept & Send to Review**

        - Choose this option to initiate the **peer-review process**.
        - Proceed to assign appropriate reviewers to evaluate the manuscript.

    - **Accept & Skip Review**

        - Use this option when no peer review is needed.
        - The manuscript will move **directly to production**.

    - **Decline Submission**

        - Select this if the manuscript:
            - Falls **outside the scope** of the journal.
            - Does not meet the **minimum quality standards**.
            - Has serious **ethical or formatting violations**.

### 5. Notify the Author Automatically

    - Upon selection of a decision, Kryoni JMS **automatically sends an email notification** to the author.
    - The notification includes:
        - The decision outcome (accepted for review, skipped review, or declined).
        - Any editor comments or recommendations.

:::note
If the submission requires changes before it can proceed, use the **“Request Changes”** option to provide feedback and ask the author to update the manuscript accordingly.
