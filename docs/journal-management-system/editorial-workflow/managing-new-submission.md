# Adminstrator View / Editorial Workflow

## Editorial Workflow – Managing New Submissions  

Once an author submits a manuscript, it enters the **editorial workflow**, where it is managed by the journal’s editorial team, including administrators and users with **Manage Journal** permissions. This stage is crucial in ensuring that submitted manuscripts go through a structured and transparent evaluation process before being considered for publication.

Upon submission, an **automated email notification** is sent to the **administrator or editor** with Manage Journal permissions. This notification serves as an alert to initiate the next steps in the review and editorial process.

The **editorial workflow** is designed to maintain the integrity and quality of academic publishing by systematically handling submissions, assigning reviewers, monitoring progress, and facilitating editorial decisions. Administrators and editors play a key role in managing these tasks efficiently using the **Journal Management System (JMS).**

This section will guide you through the **next steps** after manuscript submission, including:
    - **Manuscript Access & Initial Screening**
    - **Reviewer Assignment & Peer Review Process**
    - **Editorial Decision & Revision Handling**
    - **Final Approval & Production Workflow**

By understanding this workflow, administrators and editors can effectively oversee manuscript submissions, ensuring a seamless transition from submission to publication. Let’s explore each step in detail.

The **Journal Management System (JMS)** is designed to streamline the editorial workflow by providing a structured approach to managing new manuscript submissions. Once an author submits a manuscript, the system automatically notifies the **administrator or editor** with journal management permissions via email. This notification ensures that the editorial team can take prompt action on new submissions.

This section of the user manual provides step-by-step guidance on handling new manuscript submissions, from accessing the system to conducting an AI-assisted evaluation.

### Steps to Manage a New Submission

#### 1. Login to Kryoni JMS

    - a. Navigate to the journal management system and enter your credentials.

#### 2. Access the Journal

    - a. Click on the specific journal where the submission has been made.

#### 3. View the Submission List

#### 3. AI- Review

##### Utilize AI Tools for Submission Evaluation

The **AI Review** section within Kryoni JMS provides integrated tools to assist editors in evaluating manuscripts more efficiently.

One of the key AI-assisted features available in Kryoni JMS is the **Out-of-Scope (OOS) Score Checker.**

### AI-Assisted Features Include

#### OOS Score Checker – Ensuring Manuscript Relevance

#### What is the OOS Score Checker?

The **Out-of-Scope (OOS) Score Checker** is an AI-powered tool designed to assess whether a submitted manuscript aligns with the journal’s scope and subject area. It analyzes the manuscript’s content and compares it against predefined journal focus areas to determine its **relevance and suitability.**

#### How Does the OOS Score Checker Work?

**1. Text Analysis** – The AI scans the manuscript’s **title, abstract, keywords, and main content** to extract key concepts and subject matter.

**2. Scope Matching** – It compares the extracted data with the journal’s defined subject areas, ensuring alignment with the journal’s focus.

**3. Relevance Scoring** – The system assigns an OOS Score, indicating the degree to which the manuscript aligns with the journal’s scope.

#### Why is the OOS Score Checker Important?

    - **Saves Editorial Time:** Instead of manually checking each submission for relevance, the AI quickly evaluates whether a manuscript aligns with the journal’s focus, allowing editors to prioritize relevant submissions.
    - **Improves Decision Accuracy:** Editors receive a **data-driven assessment** to support their decision on whether to accept or reject a submission based on scope alignment.
    - **Enhances Author Guidance:** If a manuscript is flagged as out of scope, authors can be provided with **early feedback,** reducing unnecessary review cycle.

### Workflow

This feature is helpful for **clarifying submission details, requesting additional information, or discussing necessary changes** before deciding whether a revision is needed.

#### Use Case: Initiating a Pre-Review Discussion

An editor reviews a newly submitted manuscript and has a few clarifications regarding formatting and missing details. Instead of requesting a revision immediately, the editor decides to start a **Pre-Review Discussion** with the author.

#### Steps to Initiate a Pre-Review Discussion

##### 1. Navigate to the Submission Page

    a. Click on the specific manuscript submission.
    b. Go to the **"Pre-Review Discussion"** section.

##### 2. Add Discussion

    - Click on the **"Add Discussion"** button.

    ![image](/assets/images/submissions/add-discussion-window.webp)

##### 5. Submit the Discussion

a. Click **"Add Discussion"** to notify the author and other participants.

This feature ensures smooth communication between the editorial team and the author, facilitating a transparent and efficient review process.

#### Why Use Pre-Review Discussion?

    - Enables direct, trackable communication within the submission platform.
    - Keeps all correspondence organized in one place—no need for external emails or messaging tools.
    - Encourages quick resolution of preliminary concerns before initiating formal requests or review steps.

##### Outcome

The author receives an email notification and can respond directly within **Kryoni JMS.** This ensures a smooth communication flow before the formal review process begins.

:::warning
Discussions are for clarification and instant communication only. Please do not use this space for revision requests or other workflow actions. Use the appropriate options instead.
