# Article configuration

Choose the article type and its corresponding blind type, then click "Add." You can select multiple article types and create new ones if needed.

- **Allow editorial users to override the blind type role while assigning the reviewer:**
  - This checkbox indicates that editorial users, such as the Editor-in-Chief, can change the blind type while assigning a reviewer.

- **Allow EIC/JM to accept the submission even if all co-author verification is not completed:**
  - This checkbox indicates that if the author has added co-authors, the submission can proceed to the next step even if the co-authors haven't accepted the invitation. If this option is not selected, the submission will only proceed once all co-authors have accepted.

- **Mandate that EIC/JM to upload similarity check proof document before initiating the Peer Review process:**
  - This checkbox mandates that the Editor-in-Chief or Journal Manager must upload a proof of similarity check before starting the peer review process.

- **Allow the EIC/JM to initiate the Peer Review Process without needing to upload proof of a similarity check:**
  - This checkbox permits the Editor-in-Chief or Journal Manager to begin the peer review process without uploading a proof of similarity check.
