## Managing Change Requests in the Submission Stage

During the submission stage, editors or journal managers may request modifications to your manuscript or its associated metadata before it proceeds to peer review. Promptly addressing these requests ensures your submission stays on track without delays.

### When a Change Request Is Received

If a change request is issued:
    - You will receive an **email notification** detailing the required changes and instructions.
    - The submission status will appear as **"Change Requested"** on your Dashboard.

#### Steps for Author to Respond to a Change Request from Editorial User / Journal Manager

    1. **Log in** to your **Kryoni JMS** account.
    2. Navigate to your **Submission List Page** and locate the relevant journal submission.
