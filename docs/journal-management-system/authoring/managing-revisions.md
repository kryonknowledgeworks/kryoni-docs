## Managing Revisions in Review Stage

### Revision Requested

When a manuscript undergoes the peer review process, the editor may request revisions from the author based on reviewer feedback. This guide outlines the steps an author must take to respond to revision requests and submit the revised manuscript.

    - Navigate to your **Dashboard** and locate the journal to which your manuscript was submitted.
    - The submission status will be updated to **“Revision Requested.”**
    - Click on the submission to view the details.

#### 5. Revisions Accepted – Moving to Production

**Final Outcome:**

    - After the editor reviews and approves the revised manuscript, the submission will be accepted.
    - You will receive an email confirming that the revision has been accepted.
    - The submission status will update to **“Moved to Production”** on your dashboard.
