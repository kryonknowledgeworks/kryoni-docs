## Overview

This guide provides a detailed overview of the peer review process within the **Journal Management System (JMS)** and explains how to manage, track, and respond to reviews efficiently. Peer review is a crucial step in ensuring the quality, integrity, and credibility of published research.

### What is Peer Review?

Peer review is a structured evaluation process where independent experts assess submitted manuscripts to ensure they meet academic and publishing standards. It serves as a **quality control mechanism** that helps authors refine their work while ensuring that journals publish well-researched, original, and credible content.

#### Objectives of Peer Review

    - Verify the **accuracy, originality, and significance** of the research.
    - Provide **constructive feedback** to authors for improving their manuscripts.
    - Help journals maintain **high academic and ethical standards.**
    - Ensure transparency and **fairness in the publication process.**

### Types of Peer Review

JMS supports multiple **review models**, allowing journals to choose the process that best aligns with their editorial policies.

#### 1. Single-Blind Review

    - The **reviewer** knows the identity of the author.
    - The **author** does not know the identity of the reviewer.

This ensures reviewers provide unbiased feedback while allowing them to assess potential conflicts of interest.

#### 2. Double-Blind Review

    - The **reviewer** does not know the identity of the author.
    - The **author** does not know the identity of the reviewer.
    
This approach **eliminates biases** related to an author’s reputation, institution, or country.

#### 3. Open Review

    -  Both the **reviewer** and **author** know each other’s identities.

Encourages transparency and accountability but may lead to potential biases.

### Why is Peer Review Important?

#### 1. Quality Assurance

    -  Ensures the research adheres to **academic and ethical standards** before publication.

#### 2. Constructive Feedback

    -  Helps authors refine their **arguments, methodology, and conclusions.**

#### 3. Validation of Research

    -  Confirms the **originality and relevance** of the study in its respective field.

#### 4. Credibility & Trust

    -  A strong peer review process enhances the **journal's reputation** and credibility.
