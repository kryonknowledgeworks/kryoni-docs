## **Overview**

Creating a journal is a foundational step for any publishing house, laying the groundwork for editorial workflows, submission handling, and publishing operations. **Our Journal Management System (JMS)** simplifies the setup process, requiring minimal effort so you can focus on delivering high-quality content. With this system, you can easily manage your journal's configurations and update them as your needs evolve, without disrupting existing processes.

**Why Creating a Journal Matters**

The journal creation process within JMS is essential because it serves as the framework for all future activities, including manuscript submissions, peer reviews, editorial management, and publication tracking. The setup ensures that your journal aligns with your editorial policies and meets the expectations of contributors and readers.

**Adaptability and Flexibility**

Our JMS empowers you with complete control over the journal’s settings. As your journal grows or pivots to new editorial directions, submission guidelines, or publication policies, you won’t need to restart the setup. Instead, you can adjust seamlessly within the system, ensuring continuity and smooth operations.

**Key Configuration Steps**

The setup process involves providing important details, such as the journal’s name, description, and submission policies. These details are crucial, as they will be visible to authors during the submission process and will shape how they engage with your journal.

This information helps authors understand your journal’s scope and policies, ensuring that only relevant submissions are made. It also sets clear expectations for peer review and publication timelines, fostering smoother collaboration between authors, reviewers, and editors.

**Tracking ID Configuration**

Tracking ID configuration is an essential step for organizing and tracking journal submissions efficiently. If your publishing house uses a specific set of tracking IDs for submissions and wants to maintain consistency, this feature allows you to assign a customized tracking format for each journal. The tracking ID helps in easily identifying, sorting, and following up on submissions.

**Purpose of Tracking ID Configuration**

- **Consistency Across Submissions:** Maintain a uniform tracking system across all journals and submissions.

- **Seamless Continuity:** Use your existing tracking system by assigning the same identifiers to new submissions within the platform.

- **Efficient Monitoring:** Quickly locate and manage submissions based on their unique tracking IDs.

**How to Configure Tracking ID for a Journal **

**Submission Tracking ID Prefix**

- **Prefix:** Enter a unique prefix (e.g., JMS2024) that will be attached to all tracking IDs for submissions within this journal.

- This prefix can reflect your journal’s name, publishing house, or the year of submission.

- **Example:** A submission ID may look like JMS2024-0001.

**Sequence Starting Number**

- **Initial Number:** Define the starting point of the submission sequence.

- For example, if the sequence starts at 1000, the first submission ID will be JMS2024-1000.

- Choose a sequence that aligns with your internal tracking or reporting system.

**Tracking Number Digits:**

- **Tracking Number Format:** Define the number of digits for the tracking sequence (e.g., 4 or 6 digits).

- A 4-digit format would display the tracking ID as JMS2024-0001, while a 6-digit format would appear as JMS2024-000001.

- Consistent formatting ensures submissions are easy to identify and track.

**Warning – Finalizing the Settings:**

**Important:** <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>Once the tracking ID configuration is finalized, these settings cannot be changed.</span>

**Double-Check:** Ensure that all entries are correct before saving the configuration. Changes will not be possible after the journal setup is complete.
