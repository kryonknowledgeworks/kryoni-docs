## **Dashboard Overview**

The **Dashboard** in our Journal Management System (JMS) provides a comprehensive report and statistics that reflect the overall performance and activity within your journal. This feature is available to both the Editor-in-Chief (EIC) and Journal Manager (JM), ensuring transparency and ease of access for key decision-makers.

The dashboard offers data and insights from the very beginning, starting from the journal's creation. It tracks critical metrics that help you monitor submissions, editorial decisions, and the overall publication process. Below is an overview of the key elements displayed in the dashboard

**In Review:** Indicates the number of articles that have been accepted by the Editor-in-Chief or Journal Manager during the submission stage and are now under review. This stage involves peer review and editorial evaluation.

**In Production:** Displays the number of articles that have successfully passed the review stage and have moved into the production phase, where final formatting and preparation for publication take place.

**Decision Pending:** Represents the number of articles where a decision—whether to accept or reject—has not yet been made. These submissions are awaiting further action by the editorial team.

**Declined Articles @ Submission**: Shows the number of articles that were declined during the submission stage, before reaching the review process. These submissions did not meet the journal’s initial requirements or standards.

**Declined Articles @ Review:** Reflects the number of articles that were declined after undergoing the review process. This metric indicates how many manuscripts were rejected based on reviewer feedback or editorial decisions during the review stage.

**Published Articles:** Displays the number of articles that have been successfully published. These submissions have passed all stages of the editorial workflow, including submission, review, and production.

### **Submisssion Url**

**How Authors Submit Manuscripts**

The Submission URL is an essential feature within the Journal Management System (JMS), providing authors with direct access to your journal's submission portal. This unique URL can be embedded within your journal's website or shared through other communication channels, offering a seamless way for authors to initiate the manuscript submission process.

Once authors click on the Submission URL, they are directed to the submission interface where they can upload their manuscripts, enter required metadata, and submit supporting documents for review. This URL is crucial for managing the submission workflow, ensuring authors can easily contribute their research.

In summary, the Submission URL connects authors with your journal efficiently, facilitating a smooth submission process while maintaining the integrity and organization of the editorial workflow.
