## File Format

![image](/assets/images/file-format.webp)

The File Format Configuration section in the Journal Management System (JMS) enables administrators to define and manage the acceptable file formats for manuscript submissions and editorial processes. This ensures that all uploaded documents adhere to the journal’s technical standards, creating a seamless workflow for authors, editors, and reviewers.

By specifying allowed file types, the system maintains consistency and compatibility throughout the publication process—from submission to final publication. The platform supports multiple formats such as PDF, DOC, DOCX, image files, etc providing flexibility while ensuring a structured editorial process.

### How to Configure File Formats

### Configuring File Types and Formats

**To configure a file type:**

    - Select a **File Type** from the dropdown (e.g., Manuscript, Tables, Figures).
    - Choose the allowed **File Formats** (e.g., PDF, DOCX, PNG).

    - Enable the **Mandatory** checkbox if this file is required for submission.
