Both the Journal Manager and the Editorial User have all access to the manuscript, allowing them to review, edit, accept, or reject the submission.

This section outlines the access and actions available to editorial users following the submission of the manuscript from the author.

Go to Journal Settings > User Role Settings.

Click **Create Role**

Return to Submission Page: Once the user is registered, return to the submission page and click Assign to link the user to the participant List.

### **Advantage Of Assign Participants**

**Customized Role Assignment:**

The Create Role feature allows you to tailor roles according to the specific needs of your journal. You can assign roles with specific permissions related to submission, review, and production, ensuring that each user has access to the necessary sections without having permissions for the entire system.

**Targeted Access Control**
Assigning participants gives you control over who can access and perform actions on a particular submission. This enables you to maintain a streamlined and secure workflow by ensuring only the necessary people are involved in each submission's lifecycle.

**Role Flexibility Across Stages**

You can assign specific participants at each stage of the submission, such as submission, review, and production. This allows for targeted decision-making and involvement at critical points in the submission process without cluttering workflows with unnecessary participants.

**Permission Settings**

The JMS permission system enables you to set Read, Manage, and Decision-Making capabilities, allowing fine-tuned control over what each participant can do. For example, an editor may have decision-making authority, while a reviewer may only have read and manage permissions.

**Adaptability to Journal Requirements**

Every journal has different requirements for the submission and review process. By allowing for customizable role creation and participant assignment, the JMS ensures that each journal can adapt the system to its unique workflow, ensuring smooth operations.

### **Making Editorial Decisions**

As an editorial user, you are responsible for making key decisions that determine the progression of a manuscript through the submission workflow. These decisions ensure that only high-quality, relevant content moves forward in the journal's publication process. Below is an elaboration of the possible editorial decisions you can make:

**Accept and Send for Review:** Approve the manuscript and send it to reviewers for feedback.

**Purpose:** This decision approves the manuscript and sends it to external reviewers for detailed evaluation and feedback.

**Next Step:**

Once accepted, the manuscript is assigned to appropriate reviewers who will provide feedback on its content. Their reviews will guide any revisions or further editorial decisions.

- **Accept and Skip Review:** Approve the manuscript without sending it for external review

**Purpose:** This decision approves the manuscript without external peer review and sends it directly to the production stage.

**Next Step:**

The manuscript is immediately advanced to the production phase, where it will be prepared for publication.

- **Decline Submission:** Reject the manuscript if it does not meet the journal’s standards or requirements.

**Purpose:** This decision rejects the manuscript if it does not meet the journal’s standards, scope, or submission requirements.

**Next Step:**

The author is notified of the rejection, often with reasons provided to help them understand the decision. The manuscript is removed from the submission process.

These decisions are critical for maintaining the journal's quality and reputation. By exercising careful judgment, you ensure that the best content progresses through the review and publication process.
