## **Submission**

 At this stage, new submissions are received, assigned to the Editor-in-Chief (EIC), and evaluated to decide if they should proceed to the review stage. Submissions that do not meet the guidelines may be declined during this stage.

## **Peer Review**

 In this stage, the peer review process occurs, along with any necessary revisions by the author. Some submissions may not pass this stage and will be terminated here. Submissions that are accepted proceed to the next stage.

## **Production**

- Enhance task management and tracking by integrating Job Nest with our platform.

- If you choose not to integrate Job Nest, you can download the completed review file, format it as needed, and upload the formatted file to the production completed folder.

- The author has a chance to proofread the galleys again. Once everyone is satisfied, the submission is scheduled for publication in an upcoming issue.
