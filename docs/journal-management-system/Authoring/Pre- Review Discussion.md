## **Overview**

The **Pre-Review Discussion** feature within the Journal Management System (JMS) allows authors to engage in preliminary discussions with the Journal Manager and Editorial Chief regarding any questions or necessary changes related to their manuscript prior to the review process. This collaborative tool facilitates clear communication and ensures that all parties are aligned before the manuscript enters formal review.

**Subject:**

- Enter a concise subject line that summarizes the main topic of the discussion. This helps all participants quickly understand the focus of the conversation.

_Discussion Description:_

- Provide a detailed description of the issues or topics you wish to discuss. This section should clearly outline your questions, or any necessary changes related to your manuscript.

**Upload Files:**

If there are any relevant documents or files that support your discussion (e.g., supplementary data, previous correspondence, or clarifications), you can upload them directly in this section.
