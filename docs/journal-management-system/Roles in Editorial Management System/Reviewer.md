# Reviewer

The process of journal submission involves the assignment of one or more reviewers by the editorial user to assess the submission. The reviewers are tasked with evaluating the content and providing their feedback on the submissions. Along with their reviews, reviewers have the option to suggest revisions to the submission if they believe it is necessary to improve its quality or address any concerns.
