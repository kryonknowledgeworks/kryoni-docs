## Suppliers

In the **Editorial Management System**, once a manuscript successfully passes peer review, it enters the **Production Stage**. This phase often involves tasks like **copyediting**, **typesetting**, and **proofing**, typically handled by third-party suppliers.

The **Journal Management System (JMS)** simplifies this process by allowing you to manage all production-related activities directly within a single, intuitive platform—eliminating the need for manual coordination or scattered communication.

### Key features

    - Invite and onboard production suppliers seamlessly
    - Assign tasks such as copyediting, typesetting, and proofreading
    - Automate task distribution to streamline workflows
    - Enable or disable supplier access as needed from the admin dashboard

### How to add a supplier

    - Begin the onboarding process for a new production service provider.
2. **Enter the invite code**

 This code is generated from the supplier’s account (see below for how to obtain it).

### Obtaining the invite code (Supplier Side)

Before sending the invite, ensure the supplier is **registered** on the JMS portal.
