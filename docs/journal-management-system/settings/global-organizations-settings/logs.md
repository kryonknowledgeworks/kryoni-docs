## Logs

For security and transparency, all actions performed within our Journal Management System (JMS) are automatically recorded as logs. Every event, from journal creation to publication, is logged with a times, ensuring that every step in the editorial and publishing process is tracked.

### Key Features of the Log System

**Permanent Records:** Once an action is logged, it cannot be edited or deleted, ensuring all records remain accurate.

**Detailed Tracking:** Every activity—such as submissions, user management, or publishing—is recorded, giving you a full history of events.
