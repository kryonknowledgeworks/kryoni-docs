By default, the user status is set to **Active**, meaning the user is immediately enabled to access the JMS upon accepting the invitation. (If needed, you can adjust this setting to **inactive**)

### Finalizing The Invitation

After completing all mandatory fields and verifying the information, click invite user. The new user will receive instructions on how to access the system and manage their tasks based on their assigned role.

This comprehensive approach to user management helps ensure a secure and efficient workflow within the JMS, providing every user with the appropriate level of access for their role in the publication process.

### User Invited

Once a user is invited, their invitation appears in the pending invites section.

    - **Pending Invites:**

        Any user who has been invited but has not yet accepted the invitation will be listed here. A notification email is sent to them, and their status remains **"pending"** until they complete the registration process.

    - **Resend Invite:**

        If needed, you can resend the invitation to ensure that the user receives the necessary information to join the system.

    - **Pending Due Date:**
