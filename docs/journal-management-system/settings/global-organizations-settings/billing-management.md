## Billing Management

The Billing Management section in the JMS provides a detailed overview of your accountâ€™s billing cycle and invoice information. This feature is designed to keep you informed about your billing status and usage. Below is an explanation of the key components:

### Account Details

View your account information including Account ID, Contact Email, Contact Phone, Billing Address, Country/Region, and Currency. These details ensure that all billing-related communications are sent to the correct contact points.

### Current Billing Status

This area displays your current amount due. If no amount is due, it indicates that either your previous invoice has been paid or the invoice for the current month has not been generated yet.

### Storage Usage

Displays the total storage used by your account (e.g., 21.08 KB), which helps you monitor resource usage as part of your billing details.

By reviewing this section, you can easily track your billing cycles, understand invoice details, and manage your account expenses efficiently within the JMS.
