## Status Board

![image](/assets/images/journal/status-board.webp)

The Status Board in the Journal Management System (JMS) is a centralized dashboard that provides a real-time, single-page overview of the journalâ€™s editorial workflow. It helps editorial user efficiently track and manage manuscript progress by categorizing submissions into three distinct stages.

### Key Workflow Stages

    **Submission Stage**

        - Displays all newly submitted manuscripts.

        - Allows editors to review initial submissions and assign them to reviewers.

    **Review Stage**

        - Tracks manuscripts that have entered the peer review process.

    **Production Stage**
    
        - Lists manuscripts that have successfully passed the review stage and are in final formatting.

        - Helps ensure that accepted manuscripts are efficiently prepared for release. 
        
The **Status Board** serves as a **powerful tool** for optimizing journal operations, ensuring smooth coordination between submission, review, and publication processes.
